## Codebase Patterns
- Database schema lives in `database/schema.sql` and is applied via `python3 database/migrate.py --sql <file>`.
- Batch uploads are stored under `uploads/batches/{batch_id}` with metadata saved via `webapp.db.create_candidate_batch` and `webapp.db.insert_batch_file_upload`.

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented: Added candidate batch tables and indexes to the SQLite schema and added a migration script to apply schema SQL.
- Files changed: `database/schema.sql`, `database/migrate.py`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Schema updates are applied to `data.db` with `python3 database/migrate.py --sql database/schema.sql`.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
    - None.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - Candidate batch tables live alongside core AI filtering tables in `database/schema.sql`.

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented: Added multi-CSV batch upload API, saving files under uploads/batches/{batch_id}, capturing headers/row counts, and persisting batch/file metadata in data.db.
- Files changed: `webapp/main.py`, `webapp/db.py`, `AGENTS.md`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Batch uploads use `uploads/batches/{batch_id}` with metadata stored via `webapp.db.create_candidate_batch` and `webapp.db.insert_batch_file_upload`.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
    - None.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - Upload endpoint validates CSV extensions and stores parsed headers in `batch_file_uploads.headers`.
