decision_policy:

  dismiss: "At least one criterion is NOT_MET (clear contradictory evidence)"

output_fields:
  - overall_decision  # PROCEED | HUMAN_REVIEW | DISMISS
  - review_focus      # List of criterion IDs that are UNKNOWN
  - dismiss_reason    # Criterion ID that caused DISMISS
  - data_gaps         # Missing fields that would help evaluation

evaluation_notes: |
  CRITICAL POLICY: "Absence of evidence is NOT evidence of absence"
  - If a field is empty/missing → mark UNKNOWN (not NOT_MET)
  - Only mark NOT_MET if there is CLEAR CONTRADICTORY EVIDENCE
  - Err on the side of HUMAN_REVIEW for ambiguous cases

  This prevents false negatives where good candidates are dismissed due to incomplete data.
